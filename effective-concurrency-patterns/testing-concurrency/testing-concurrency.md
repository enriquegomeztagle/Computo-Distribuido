## Testing Concurrent Code

Testing concurrent code presents unique challenges. Ensuring that your concurrent code functions correctly and reliably is essential to avoid race conditions and other concurrency-related issues. Go provides tools and techniques for effectively testing concurrent code.

### Testing Concurrent Code in Go

Go’s testing framework includes the `testing` package, which allows you to write unit tests for concurrent code. You can use the `go test` command to run these tests in parallel, which helps uncover race conditions and synchronization problems.

Let’s see an example of testing concurrent code in Go:

In this Go example, we have a `ParallelFunction` that performs a parallel computation by launching multiple goroutines. We then have a unit test `TestParallelFunction` that checks whether the function behaves as expected.

To run the test, use the `go test` command, which automatically detects and runs tests in the current package.
