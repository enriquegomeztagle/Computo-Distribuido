## Cancellation and Context

Cancellation and context management are crucial aspects of concurrent programming. When working with concurrent tasks, itâ€™s essential to have mechanisms in place for canceling ongoing work or managing the context in which tasks are executed.

### Context and Context Cancellation in Go

Go provides the `context` package, which allows you to carry deadlines, cancellations, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. This package is particularly useful for managing the lifecycle of concurrent tasks.


In this Go example, we create a context with a cancellation function using `context.WithCancel`. We launch several worker goroutines, and each worker checks for cancellation using `ctx.Done()`. When the context is canceled (in this case, after a brief delay), the workers respond appropriately and exit.
