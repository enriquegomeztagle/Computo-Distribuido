# Parallelizing with Task Decomposition

Task decomposition allows you to divide the dataset into smaller chunks and process them concurrently. This strategy enables you to achieve parallelism and fully exploit your hardware resources. Letâ€™s illustrate this concept with a straightforward Go example.

In this Go example, we utilize goroutines and channels to implement task decomposition. The `processItem` function simulates item processing, and each item is processed concurrently. By dividing the workload into smaller, parallelizable sub-tasks, we effectively exploit the benefits of concurrency.
