## Worker Pools

Worker pools are another vital concurrency pattern, especially when dealing with a substantial number of tasks that require concurrent execution. Rather than spawning a new goroutine for each task, worker pools maintain a fixed number of worker goroutines that process tasks from a queue. This pattern helps manage resource consumption and prevents overloading the system.

### The Challenge of Unlimited Concurrency

Without a worker pool, you might be tempted to create a new goroutine for each task, especially when dealing with a large number of tasks. However, this approach can lead to resource exhaustion, increased context-switching overhead, and potential instability.

### Implementing a Worker Pool in Go

Letâ€™s examine a simplified Go example to illustrate the concept of a worker pool.

In this Go example, we implement a worker pool using goroutines and channels. Worker goroutines concurrently process tasks from the `tasks` channel and send the results back to the `results` channel. By maintaining a fixed number of worker goroutines, we ensure that only a limited number of tasks are executed concurrently, thus preventing resource exhaustion.
