# What is the Worker Pool Pattern?

The worker pool pattern involves creating a group of worker goroutines to process tasks concurrently, limiting the number of simultaneous operations. This pattern is valuable when you have a large number of tasks to execute.

Some examples of using the Worker Pool Pattern in Real-world Applications

* Handling incoming HTTP requests in a web server.
* Processing images concurrently.
