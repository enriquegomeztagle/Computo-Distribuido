# Task Decomposition

Task decomposition is a fundamental pattern for designing concurrent systems. This pattern involves breaking down a complex task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently. This approach not only helps harness the full potential of your hardware but also enhances code modularity and maintainability.

### The Need for Task Decomposition

Imagine a scenario where you need to process a massive dataset. Without task decomposition, you might opt to process each item in a sequential manner. However, this approach can be painfully slow, especially in the context of modern multi-core processors, which remain underutilized.

In this age of advanced software programming, it is important to use parallelism for better results. With the increasing complexity of applications and demands for data processing, there’s a need for coders to write efficient and reliable concurrent programs. To tackle this problem, designers have come up with templates and methods that help in the design and management of concurrent systems. In this article we will take a look at 5 basic concurrency patterns in Go that should be known: distinguishing between parallelism and concurrency, breaking down tasks, using worker pools, cancellation and context, and testing concurrent code.

# Parallelizing with Task Decomposition

Task decomposition allows you to divide the dataset into smaller chunks and process them concurrently. This strategy enables you to achieve parallelism and fully exploit your hardware resources. Let’s illustrate this concept with a straightforward Go example.

In this Go example, we utilize goroutines and channels to implement task decomposition. The `processItem` function simulates item processing, and each item is processed concurrently. By dividing the workload into smaller, parallelizable sub-tasks, we effectively exploit the benefits of concurrency.
