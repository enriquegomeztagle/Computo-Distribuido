**What is the Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern?**

The fan-out/fan-in pattern involves distributing tasks to multiple worker goroutines (fan-out) and then aggregating their results (fan-in). Itâ€™s useful for parallelizing tasks and combining their outcomes.

Some examples of using the Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern in Real-world Applications

* Web scraping multiple websites concurrently and merging the results.
* Aggregating data from multiple sensors in IoT applications.
