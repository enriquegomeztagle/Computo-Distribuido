**What is the Pipeline Pattern?**

The pipeline pattern structures a series of processing stages, with each stage executed concurrently. Data flows through these stages sequentially, allowing efficient data transformation and processing.

Some examples of using the Pipeline Pattern in Real-world Applications

* Data processing in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.
* Image processing pipelines in multimedia applications.
