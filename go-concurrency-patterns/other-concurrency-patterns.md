# Other Concurrency Patterns

Aside from the patterns mentioned above, there are several other concurrency patterns worth exploring:

* **Mutex Pattern** : Protecting shared resources using mutexes (sync.Mutex) to ensure exclusive access.
* **Semaphore Pattern** : Controlling access to resources by limiting the number of goroutines allowed at a time.
* **Barrier Pattern** : Synchronizing multiple goroutines at specific points in their execution.
* **WaitGroup Pattern** : Waiting for a collection of goroutines to finish before proceeding.



## **Summary of Key Points**

* Concurrency patterns are structured solutions to common concurrent programming problems.
* They enhance resource utilization, responsiveness, and code reliability.
* Worker Pool, Pipeline, and Fan-out/Fan-in are some of the core concurrency patterns in Go.
* Mutex, Semaphore, Barrier, and WaitGroup are additional patterns with specific use cases.
